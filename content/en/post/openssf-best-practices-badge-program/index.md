As open-source software is widely used globally, ensuring its security becomes increasingly important. The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) was born to address this challenge. Supported by the Linux Foundation, this project aims to enhance the security, reliability, and sustainability of open-source software. To achieve this goal, OpenSSF has launched the Best Practices Badge Program. This project was originally developed under the CII, but it is now part of the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Best Practices Working Group (WG). The original name of the project was the CII Best Practices badge, but it is now the OpenSSF Best Practices badge project.

## OpenSSF

The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) is a project supported by the Linux Foundation, established in 2020. OpenSSF aims to protect and enhance the security, reliability, and sustainability of the entire open-source software (OSS) ecosystem. It is a cross-industry organization that brings together various stakeholders, including corporations, open-source projects, research institutions, and government agencies, to collectively address the security challenges faced by open-source software.

The main areas of work for OpenSSF include:

1. Security best practices: improving the overall security level of the open-source ecosystem by formulating and promoting security best practices for open-source projects. For example, OpenSSF has launched the Best Practices Badge Program to encourage and help open-source projects follow software security best practices.
2. Tools and technologies: developing and maintaining tools and technologies for identifying, preventing, and fixing security vulnerabilities in open-source software. This includes vulnerability scanning tools, static code analysis tools, etc.
3. Education and training: providing education and training resources related to open-source software security, helping developers, maintainers, and users improve their security awareness and skills. These resources include online courses, seminars, guides, and articles, etc.
4. Security research: conducting research on open-source software security, providing strong support for the open-source ecosystem. Research topics include vulnerability trend analysis, security risk assessment, etc.
5. Cross-organization collaboration: promoting collaboration within and outside the industry to jointly address security challenges. OpenSSF strengthens the security defenses of the entire open-source ecosystem by collaborating with other organizations, projects, and security research teams, sharing resources and experiences.

OpenSSF was established as a result of the integration of several previously independent security projects and initiatives, including the Core Infrastructure Initiative and GitHub's Open Source Security Coalition. By bringing these projects and resources together under a unified framework, OpenSSF aims to achieve more efficient collaboration and stronger impact in addressing the increasingly severe challenges of open-source software security.

## What is the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge Program

The Best Practices Badge Program aims to encourage and assist open-source projects in following software security best practices. Inspired by the many badge systems available on GitHub, this voluntary, free, self-assessment program allows users to quickly complete an evaluation of their open-source project by filling out each best practice on the web page, while also providing guidance and standards for improving project security. The badge program has three levels: PASSING, SILVER, and GOLD, each with a certain number of security requirements.

### Badge levels and requirements

First, you need to understand the three levels of the badge program: PASSING, SILVER, and GOLD, as well as their corresponding security requirements. These requirements cover various aspects such as security policies, version control, continuous integration, etc. You can view these requirements by visiting the [official documentation](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/criteria_stats) of the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge Program.

### Register and link your project

Visit the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge [project website](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/), log in with your GitHub account, or register a new account. After completing the registration, log in to your account, click Get Your Badge Now!, and if you are logged in with a GitHub account, you can directly select your project from the Select one of your GitHub repos dropdown. Of course, open-source projects on non-GitHub platforms are also supported; just fill in the home page URL and version control repository address as required.

### Project evaluation

After submitting, you will receive an explanatory email containing some necessary instructions and an address for continuing the evaluation of your open-source project. Next, you will need to self-assess your open-source project.

![Evaluation page](https://cdn.suuny0826.com/image/2023-04-19-20230419110106.png)

The self-assessment is divided into six main categories: `Basics`, `Change Control`, `Reporting`, `Quality`, `Security`, and `Analysis`. There are 67 items for the `Passing` level, 55 for `Silver`, and 23 for `Gold`. The form will automatically fill in some content based on your GitHub project's configuration, but it's not 100% accurate. You need to fill in the content according to the actual situation of the project and supplement the proof URL or explanation in the form. After completing all the items, click `Submit(and exit)` to finish filling in the content.

### Display the badge

OpenSSF provides badge images and embedding code for easy display on various platforms. On your project page, click `Show details`, and the Markdown and HTML formats for the badge will be displayed. You can add the corresponding content to your project's `README` file, official website, etc., to show the project's commitment to following software security best practices.

Please note that as your project evolves, you need to continue paying attention to badge requirements and ensure that your project always meets these requirements. Additionally, you can use the badge as an incentive to further improve your project's security, aiming for a SILVER or GOLD badge.

## Conclusion

In summary, the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge Program provides a practical framework for open-source projects, guiding them to follow software security best practices. By encouraging project teams to focus on security, providing core guidelines and clear evaluation criteria, this program helps to raise the overall security level of the open-source ecosystem. Every member of the open-source community should pay attention to and support this project, working together to make our digital world safer and more reliable.

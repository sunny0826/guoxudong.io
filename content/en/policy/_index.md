As contributors and maintainers of the Cloud Native Community, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Personal attacks
- Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- Other unethical or unprofessional conduct.

Community maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. By adopting this Code of Conduct, community maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this community. Community maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the community team.

This code of conduct applies both within community spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the community or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior in Kubernetes may be reported by contacting the Cloud Native Community Steering Committeet via [contact@cloudnative.to](mailto:contact@cloudnative.to).

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [CNCF Community Code of Conduct v1.0](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
